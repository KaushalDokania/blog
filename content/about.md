Hi there, I'm Kaushal! I am a Software Developer based out of India and currently living in Bengaluru. 

I am a passionate coder and love to build stuffs. I love using Open Source software and sometimes contribute to them as well. I am fascinated by new softwares and technology. I really enjoy exploring about things and and understand how things work. Apart from this, I like to read and share my learnings and opinions via my blog.
